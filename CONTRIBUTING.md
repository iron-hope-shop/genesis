# Contributing to Genesis

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Genesis! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the Genesis seed repository itself. Note that this file will be replaced with project-specific contribution guidelines when Genesis generates your project.

## Core Principles

1. **Modularity First:** Keep components modular and focused on single responsibilities.
2. **Template Clarity:** Ensure templates are well-documented and include clear placeholder markers.
3. **Safety First:** All scripts should be safe by default and require explicit opt-in for potentially dangerous operations.

## Areas for Contribution

### 1. Templates
- Add new templates for different project types
- Improve existing templates with better defaults
- Add support for new frameworks or technologies

### 2. Scripts
- Enhance existing scripts with better error handling
- Add new automation capabilities
- Improve cross-platform compatibility

### 3. Documentation
- Improve template documentation
- Add examples for different use cases
- Update best practices

   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Changes:**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation as needed

4. **Test Your Changes:**
