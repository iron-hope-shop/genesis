## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Overview**
Genesis is an AI-powered project generator that transforms a simple project specification into a complete, working codebase. It eliminates the need for templates and boilerplate by dynamically generating everything based on your requirements. With powerful GitHub automation and a focus on maintainable code, Genesis helps you launch new projects faster and with better quality.

### **1.2 Objectives**
- **Rapid Bootstrapping:** Quickly convert your project specification into a working project
- **Automated Configuration:** Generate tailored configuration files, scripts, and documentation
- **GitHub Integration:** Set up repositories with labels, milestones, and branch protection
- **Extensibility:** Helper scripts remain available for ongoing project maintenance
- **Clean Output:** Genesis removes itself after generation, leaving only your project files
- **AI-Driven:** Uses artificial intelligence to understand and implement your requirements

---

## **2. Quick Start**

### **2.1 Installation**
Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/genesis.git
cd genesis
```

### **2.2 Basic Usage**

#### Step 1: Fill in Your Project Specs
- Open `PROMPT.md` in this directory
- Follow the patterns to describe your project
- Be as detailed as possible

#### Step 2: Generate Your Project
```bash
./launcher.sh [options]
```

Configuration options:
```
-h  Show help message
-i  Keep images from Genesis (creates images directory automatically)
-k  Keep all Genesis files (don't clean up)
-p  Keep PROMPT.md file
-l  Keep LICENSE file
-n  Non-interactive mode (future feature)
-g  Initialize GitHub repository
-u  GitHub username (required with -g)
-r  GitHub repository name (required with -g)
-x  Make GitHub repository private
-m  Don't keep genesis_helpers directory
-t  Reinitialize Git repository (fresh history)
```

**Important**: 
- When using the `-g` option, Git is automatically reinitialized to create a fresh repository.
- If you're not using GitHub but want a fresh Git history, use the `-t` option.
- Run Genesis in agent mode with YOLO mode enabled for best results.

This will open an interactive chat where you can:
- Refine your project requirements
- Make real-time adjustments
- Review and approve generated components

For a complete GitHub setup, use:
```bash
./launcher.sh -g -u your_username -r repo_name -x
```

---

## **3. How Genesis Works**

### **3.1 Project Structure**
Genesis has a simple, minimalist design with these key components:

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ PROMPT.md           # Your project specification template
â”œâ”€â”€ launcher.sh         # The script that launches the generator
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md           # This documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ images/             # Directory for project images
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ banner.gif      # Project banner
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ static.jpeg     # Static images
â””â”€â”€ genesis_helpers/    # Helper scripts for GitHub integration and project setup
    â”œâ”€â”€ github.sh       # Core GitHub API integration functions
    â”œâ”€â”€ setup_labels.sh # Standard label setup script
    â”œâ”€â”€ project_setup.sh # Issues and milestones setup script
    â””â”€â”€ branch_protection.sh # Branch protection rules setup
```

Additional files:
- `LICENSE` - MIT license for the project
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Version history
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `.temp/` - Temporary backup of original files
- `genesis/` - Supporting directory (removed during cleanup unless -k is used)

The `genesis_helpers` scripts are kept by default to provide ongoing support for repository management. They're used both during initialization and can be used later for maintenance tasks.

### **3.2 GitHub Integration**
Genesis includes powerful GitHub automation through the helper scripts:

```bash
# Initialize repository with complete GitHub setup in one step
./launcher.sh -g -u your_username -r repo_name -x
```

This will:
1. Create a GitHub repository (public by default, private with -x)
2. Initialize git in the current directory
3. Set up the remote origin
4. **Automatically set up standard labels**
5. **Create initial milestones and issues**
6. **Configure branch protection rules**

The helper scripts can also be used individually at any time:

```bash
# Just set up labels
./genesis_helpers/setup_labels.sh

# Set up initial project milestones and issues
./genesis_helpers/project_setup.sh "Your Project Name"

# Set up branch protection (for main and develop branches)
./genesis_helpers/branch_protection.sh

# Perform specific GitHub operations
./genesis_helpers/github.sh create_issue "Issue title" "Issue description" "bug,enhancement"
./genesis_helpers/github.sh create_milestone "v1.0" "First release" "2023-12-31"
./genesis_helpers/github.sh add_collaborator "username" "admin"
```

### **3.3 Process Flow**
Genesis streamlines project generation with this process:

1. You describe your project using our structured specification format in `PROMPT.md`
2. Run the launcher with your desired configuration options
3. If GitHub integration is enabled, it automatically sets up your repository
4. The launcher opens an interactive chat session
5. **Enable agent mode with YOLO mode** for autonomous decision-making
6. The AI analyzes your requirements and works with you to refine them
7. Genesis generates your project structure and codebase with your guidance
8. All necessary files, configurations, and documentation are created
9. Original files are backed up to a `.temp` directory
10. Genesis cleans up, removing itself according to your chosen options (keeping helper scripts by default)

## **6. Command Reference & Prompt Guide**

### **6.1 Common Post-Generation Commands**

After generating your project, here are useful commands you might need:

#### GitHub Management
```bash
# Create a new issue
./genesis_helpers/github.sh create_issue "Bug: Login not working" "The login form submission fails when..." "bug,priority:high"

# Create a new milestone
./genesis_helpers/github.sh create_milestone "v1.1.0" "Feature Release" "2024-06-30"

# Add a collaborator
./genesis_helpers/github.sh add_collaborator "username" "admin"

# Set up a GitHub Actions secret
./genesis_helpers/github.sh setup_actions_secret "API_KEY" "your-secret-api-key"
```

#### Git Repository Management
```bash
# Start with a fresh Git history (if you didn't use -t or -g)
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Push to a remote repository you set up later
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### Branch Management
```bash
# Set up protection for a custom branch
./genesis_helpers/branch_protection.sh feature 2

# Create standard labels if you modified them
./genesis_helpers/setup_labels.sh
```

#### Project Management
```bash
# Reset project milestones with a new project name
./genesis_helpers/project_setup.sh "New Project Name"
```

### **6.2 Extending Helper Scripts**

The `genesis_helpers` scripts are designed to be extensible. You can add your own custom functions:

1. **Adding Custom Functions to Existing Scripts**:
   ```bash
   # Add to github.sh
   function my_custom_github_function() {
     # Your custom code here
     gh api ...
   }
   ```

2. **Creating New Helper Scripts**:
   ```bash
   # Create a new script, e.g., my_custom_helper.sh
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Import the GitHub helper for its functions
   source "$(dirname "$0")/github.sh"
   
   # Define your custom functions
   function custom_setup() {
     # Your setup code here
   }
   
   # Call the function directly if script is executed
   if [[ "$1" ]]; then
     "$@"
   fi
   ```

3. **Make it executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x genesis_helpers/my_custom_helper.sh
   ```

### **6.3 Structuring Future Prompts**
