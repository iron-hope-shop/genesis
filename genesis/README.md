# Genesis Core Reference

This directory contains the "prime directives" and reference materials that guide the AI assistant in maintaining and extending your project. **Do not delete this directory** as it provides essential guidance for future modifications.

## Purpose

The `genesis` directory serves as the AI's reference point for:

1. **Maintaining consistency** in code style, structure, and practices
2. **Ensuring documentation** remains up-to-date (especially CHANGELOG.md)
3. **Following best practices** for your specific technology stack
4. **Performing comprehensive checks** before implementing changes

## Contents

- **PRIME_DIRECTIVE.md**: Core principles and operational guidelines
- **CHECKLIST.md**: Detailed verification steps for different types of actions
- **PATTERNS.md**: Common code patterns and best practices for various technologies
- **README.md**: This file - explains the purpose of the genesis directory

## How to Use

When requesting changes from the AI assistant, you can specifically direct it to:

1. "Review the prime directive before proceeding"
2. "Follow the checklist for feature addition"
3. "Apply the appropriate patterns from the reference"

Even without explicit directions, the AI will reference these files before significant changes to ensure consistency and quality.

## Customization

You can modify these files to better align with your project's specific requirements:

- Add project-specific coding patterns
- Customize checklists with additional verification steps
- Extend the prime directive with company-specific guidelines

The AI will adapt to your customizations and follow your specific guidance.

## Remember

The `genesis` directory represents the "memory" and "principles" of your project's AI assistance. By preserving and evolving these files, you ensure that all future changes maintain the same level of quality and consistency established at the project's creation.
